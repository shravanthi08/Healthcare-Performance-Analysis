# Phase 1: Data Analysis & Segmentation (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This notebook focuses on preparing and analyzing healthcare performance data using Python.  
It transforms the raw dataset into a cleaned, structured format and generates insights through exploratory analysis and segmentation.

## 🔎 Key Steps
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns using Pandas.
- **Preprocessing**: Converted data types and standardized features for consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examined distributions, correlations, and trends with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- **Segmentation**: Grouped patients by demographics, treatment type, and insurance coverage.


## 📊 Outputs
- Cleaned dataset (`Cleaned_Health_Dataset.xlsx`)
- Notebook: `Health_Performance_Data_Phase1.ipynb`


## ⚙️ Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
