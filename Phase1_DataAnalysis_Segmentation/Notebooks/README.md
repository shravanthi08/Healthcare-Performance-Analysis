# Phase 1: Data Analysis & Segmentation (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This notebook focuses on preparing and analyzing healthcare performance data using Python.  
It transforms the raw dataset into a cleaned, structured format and generates insights through exploratory analysis and segmentation.

## 🔎 Key Steps
- **Data Cleaning (Python/Pandas)**: Handled missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns to prepare a reliable dataset.
- **Preprocessing (Python/Pandas)**: Converted data types and standardized features for consistency.
- **SQL Schema Design**: Structured the cleaned dataset into a relational schema using MySQL for organized storage and efficient querying.
- **Segmentation (SQL + Pandas)**: Grouped patients by demographics, treatment type, and insurance coverage for deeper insights.


## 📊 Outputs
- Cleaned dataset (`Cleaned_Health_Dataset.xlsx`)
- Notebook: `Health_Performance_Data_Phase1.ipynb`


## ⚙️ Tools
- Python (Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook
- MYSQL Workbench
