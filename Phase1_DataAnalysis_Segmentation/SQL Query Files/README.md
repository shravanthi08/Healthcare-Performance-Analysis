# SQL Query Files

## 📌 Overview
This folder contains SQL scripts used in Phase 1 of the healthcare performance analysis project.  
The queries were performed on the **cleaned dataset after schema design**, serving as exploratory analysis to extract insights, validate data, and prepare structured outputs for further use in Python.

## 🔎 Key Tasks
- Querying patient records by demographics, treatment type, and insurance coverage
- Aggregating hospital performance metrics (revenue, satisfaction scores, length of stay)
- Exploring outcome distributions and age group segmentation
- Preparing structured outputs for reproducibility and downstream analysis
- Exporting query results into CSV files (`Query_wise CSV Files/`) for integration with Python notebooks

## 📊 Outputs
- Individual query results saved as CSV files
- Screenshots of query outputs (`SQL Query Screenshots/`)
- Intermediate datasets supporting Phase 1 cleaning, segmentation, and EDA

## ⚙️ Tools
- SQL (MySQL schema + exploratory queries)
