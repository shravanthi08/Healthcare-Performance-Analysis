### 📌 Role in Phase 2
This dataset provides the structured input required for building and evaluating machine learning models.  
It ensures consistency and reliability by carrying forward the preprocessing done in Phase 1.

### ✅ Why It’s Helpful
- Encoded categorical variables make the dataset compatible with ML algorithms.
- Standardized numerical features improve model accuracy and comparability.
- Balanced and cleaned records reduce bias and noise in predictions.
- Provides a reproducible foundation for training, testing, and validating models.

### 📊 Usage in Phase 2
- Used in `Health_Performance_Data_Phase2.ipynb` for model training and evaluation.
- Supports Logistic Regression and Random Forest workflows.
- Enables calculation of performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
- Forms the basis for visual outputs such as confusion matrix heatmaps, metrics comparison charts, and feature importance plots.
