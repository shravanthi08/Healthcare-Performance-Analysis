# Model_csv's

## 📌 Overview
This folder contains the output CSV files generated during Phase 2 of the healthcare performance analysis project.  
These files capture the results of machine learning workflows, including model evaluation metrics, predictions, and feature importance scores.

## 🔎 Key Contents
- **ML_Metrics.csv** → Stores evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) for Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
- **ML_Predictions.csv** → Contains predicted outcomes from the trained models on the test dataset.
- **Feature_Importance.csv** → Lists feature importance scores extracted from the Random Forest model, highlighting the most influential variables.

## 📊 Usage
- **ML_Metrics.csv**: Used to compare model performance and select the best algorithm.
- **ML_Predictions.csv**: Provides predicted results for validation and visualization.
- **Feature_Importance.csv**: Supports bar chart visualization of top features influencing predictions.

## ⚙️ Tools
- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
