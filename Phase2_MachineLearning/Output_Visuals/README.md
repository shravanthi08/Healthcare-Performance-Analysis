# Output_Visuals

## 📌 Overview
This folder contains visual outputs generated during Phase 2 of the healthcare performance analysis project.  
The visuals provide a clear representation of model evaluation results and feature importance, making the machine learning outcomes easy to interpret.

## 🔎 Key Contents
- **Confusion_Matrix_Random_Forest.png** → Confusion matrix showing classification performance of the Random Forest model.
- **Confusion_Matrix_Logistic_Regression.png** → Confusion matrix showing classification performance of the Logistic Regression model.
- **Feature_Importance_Barchart.png** → Bar chart highlighting the most influential features identified by the Random Forest model.

## 📊 Usage
- Confusion matrices help evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, and misclassifications.
- Feature importance visualization highlights key variables driving predictions.
- These outputs support recruiter‑friendly storytelling by visually demonstrating model performance and insights.

## ⚙️ Tools
- Python (Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
