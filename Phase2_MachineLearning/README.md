# Phase 2: Machine Learning Basics

## 📌 Overview
This phase applies machine learning models to predict healthcare performance outcomes, building on the segmented data from Phase 1.

## 🔎 Steps
- Encoding categorical variables
- Train/test split
- Model building:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Feature Importance

## 📊 Outputs
- ML notebook: `Phase2_ML.ipynb`
- Trained models (`models/random_forest.pkl`)
- Visuals: confusion matrix heatmap, metrics comparison chart, feature importance bar chart

## ⚙️ Tools
- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau (for dashboards)
