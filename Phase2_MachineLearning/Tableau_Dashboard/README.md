# Health_Analytics_Dashboard Phase2

## 📌 Overview
This dashboard presents the machine learning results from Phase 2 of the healthcare performance analysis project.  
It provides recruiter‑friendly visualizations of model evaluation, comparisons, and feature importance to highlight predictive insights.

## 🔎 Key Contents
- **Confusion Matrix – Random Forest** → Visual representation of classification accuracy and misclassifications for the Random Forest model.
- **Confusion Matrix – Logistic Regression** → Visual representation of classification accuracy and misclassifications for the Logistic Regression model.
- **Model Metrics Comparison Charts** → Side‑by‑side comparison of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores across models.
- **Feature Importance Bar Chart** → Highlights the most influential features driving predictions in the Random Forest model.

## 📊 Usage
- Confusion matrices help evaluate and compare model performance visually.
- Metrics comparison charts provide a clear benchmark between Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- Feature importance visualization supports interpretability by showing which variables most impact predictions.
- Together, these visuals make Phase 2 results transparent, reproducible, and recruiter‑ready.

## ⚙️ Tools
- Tableau (interactive dashboards and charts)
- Cleaned dataset from Phase 1 (as input for ML models)
