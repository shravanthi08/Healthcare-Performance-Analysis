# Healthcare-Performance-Analysis Project

**Executive Summary** : 

This project evaluates healthcare performance data across two phases: Phase 1 focuses on patient segmentation and exploratory analysis, while Phase 2 applies machine learning models to predict healthcare outcomes. It demonstrates the ability to combine domain knowledge, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling to support decision-making in healthcare management.

**Problem Statement** : 

Healthcare providers face challenges in understanding patient behavior, predicting outcomes, and improving service efficiency. The goal was to analyze patient datasets, identify performance drivers, and build predictive models that support better resource allocation and patient care strategies.

**Approach** : 
**Tools Used** : Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebooks, SQL.

**Workflow** : 

**Phase 1** : 

* Data cleaning and preprocessing.

* Patient segmentation using statistical methods.

* Exploratory data analysis to identify key healthcare KPI's.

**Phase 2** : 

* Applied machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

* Evaluated model performance with accuracy, precison, recall, and ROC curves.

* Generated visual outputs to explain predictions and feature importance.

**Reports** : Summarized findings and recommendations across both phases.

**Results/Impact** : 

* Segmented patients into meaningful groups based on demographics and healthcare usage.

* Identified key performance drivers such as treatment frequency, patient satisfaction, and resource utilization.

* Built predictive models achieving strong accuracy in outcome prediction.

* Delivered dashboards and visualizations to communicate insights effectively.

**Career Impact** : 

This project highlights the ability to apply data science and machine learning to healthcare performance analysis, combining technincal expertise with domain knowledge. It demonstrates readiness for analytics roles in healthcare and consulting where data-driven insights directly improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
